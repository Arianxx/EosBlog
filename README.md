## A Simple Example Blog Implemented by Flask

This is a simple personal Blog that implemented by Flask web framework. It has some basic features of a blog like loggin, logout, follow, permission control, avatar, etc. It also has a azure blue theme.

I also sincerely hope that it would help you.

The blog hasn't been completed yet. I will add more functionalities in the future.

Todo:

- [ ] Tags.
- [ ] Api.
- [ ] Third party login.
- [ ] Search.

Simple Usage:
1. Use the `pipenv install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` command to install the dependencies.
2. Add a environment variable named `FLASK_APP` which value is equal to this blog's directory path.
3. Execute the `flask run` command in your command line environment.
